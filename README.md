# Primes
This program could take as argument the following:

* -t [time_in_seconds] [space_in_memory_in_MB] -> generates all the possible prime numbers in the given time, without going over the given space in memory. If there's still time left but no space, then it gives you the option to save them in a file or display them and continue.

* -p [any_positive_integer] -> Tells you how many prime numbers are before the given number (inclusive).
* -n [any_positive_integer] -> Returns the nth prime, being -n-th the given number.
* -i [any_positive_integer] -> Tells wheter the given number is prime.
* -f [any_positive_integer] -> Prints or saves on a file the first n prime numbers, where n is the passed number.
* -m [any_positive_integer] -> Saves on a pointer the first prime numbers that fit in X MB, where X is the passed number.
